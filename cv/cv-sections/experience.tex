{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
\item {Developed a recurrent neural net for predicting heat exchanger failures. Model was the first deployed solution at Enterprise, implemented in the first 8 weeks of hire.}
\item {Built a Monte Carlo simulation that optimized spare parts inventory, potential savings in the multi-millions.}

{Data Scientist} % Job title
{Sanchez Energy} % Organization
{Houston, TX} % Location
{Apr 2017 - May 2019} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
\item {Developed a model fitting solution for determining a well's spontaneous (SP) log curve using peak detection methods and Kalman filters. The end result is used for identifying potential oil field plays to target.}
\item {Developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo solution for simulating a well's decline curve and ultimate recovery. This augmented Engineering's decision making on how much a well will make over it's lifetime.}
\item {Optimized a geophysics simulator written in Python which decreased runtime by 6x and lines of code were reduced 10x.}
\item {Contributed to the development of a multi model prediction framework for predicting well production. The solution was a significant improvement on the industry standard decline curve fitting.}
\item {Implemented a realtime alert for detecting tubing leaks which resulted in a cost savings in the six figures. An industry standard deterministic model was required by Engineering, the model was optimized by sampling the search space with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator.}
